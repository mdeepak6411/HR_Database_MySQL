## MySQL
## HR_Database

In this project, I have developed an HR Database to store and manage personal information relating to their employees using MySQL database.
the HR database contains 4 tables i.e. Employees, Departments, Contact Details, and Locations and each table stores its related employee's data like Employees table stores Employees general information i.e Emp ID, Name, Gender, Hire date and salary, and the Departments table stores each employee department data i.e. Dept_ID, Department name and the locations table stores each employee address i.e. city, state, country and postal code and the contactdetails table store each employees contact information i.e. phone number, emails, etc.
I have designed this HR database in a way where each table is associated with other tables with the help of a unique key or primary key and to maintain referential integrity I have applied foreign key on each dimension table.
